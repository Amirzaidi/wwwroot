Chronological scripts, also called cron scripts, are scripts that are ran every `x` seconds
The database keeps track of when all your scripts ran for the last time, and how often they should run
The actual php code can be found in the directory /cron/ in your webhost root, in the function with the same name as the file

If for example 45 seconds have passed since the last time a script that should be ran every 20 seconds was executed,
it will be executed twice and once more in 15 seconds (if the page is loaded in exactly 15 seconds)
NB: Not in 20 seconds, the interval will be shortened to catch up with the lost time
