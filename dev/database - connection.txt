The connection the mysql server is made in the index.php file in the root directory with the mysql::connect() function
This function takes two parameters: the first is the password, the second the name of the database
Localhost and root will automatically be used as the hostname and username for the mysql server

The only required database table is the cronjob table to make use of the cron scripts
